# chatgpthelpers

Simple bookmarklet to find the context by name.

## How to use

Create a bookmark on your Chrome bookmarks bar. Edit it, and copy the search.js code into the url location.

Click the bookmark and it will ask you for a search term.

## Why?

Because contexts are how you _should_ use chatGPT and with that you _should_ have a search to jump to your contexts.

## What did you code it _that_ way?

Because this is a temporary hack... so who cares? This "search" ability has _got_ to be coming if OpenAI is worth its salt.
